# Machine Learning base player

- model : Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)

## Pretraind Model

- The model train was performed by fighting with random players and Miwa's alpha-beta player many times (more than 30,000 times).
- Model is comparable with Miwa's alpha-beta player (depth 5).

## TODO

- The model is not constructed independently the first and second hand. The model which have independent weight first and second should be stronger. (Second hand is weak.)
- Fight with myself may make stronger.
